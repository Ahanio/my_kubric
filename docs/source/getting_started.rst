Getting Started
===============

Kubric is a Python package and can be installed with pip as usual, but it depends on the Blender Python module ``bpy``, which is non-trivial to install.
There are several ways to use Kubric from most to least recommended:

#. Using the provided Docker image (recommended)
#. Installing using `blenderpy` https://github.com/TylerGubala/blenderpy
#. Build ``bpy`` from source
#. Run through Blender CLI instead of Python


The easiest way to use Kubric is therefore with the provided docker image ``klausgreff/kubruntu:latest``.
